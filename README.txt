***********************************************Assignment 1 - Simple Shell***********************************************Author: Isaac GordonClass: CSCI 340 - MoWe at 1:40pmProfessor: Prof. Joseph Svitak_________________________________The program SimpleShell allows you to run all commands that are native to the command line of your operating system. It is compatible with UNIX, Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. All aspects of project specification have been implemented, including newly defined commands “history”, “!!”, and “!<i>” where the number of items in history is n and 0 <= i < n. After exhaustive testing and maintenance, the program functions as specified, however the following issues persist:<ON MAC:> - The command “help” is does not work. All other tested commands (rm, mkdir, lpr, cd, ls, and others) function as they would if they were executed from the terminal directly.<ON WINDOWS:>- When the user enters an invalid command, it seems ProcessBuilder.start() does not throw an IOException. Therefore, no error message is shown to the user. (On Mac OS, an IOException is thrown and the error message is sent to the user.)- When the user executes a command that prints output and then asks for input, for example the command “time”, the line requesting user input does not show.

<NOTE ON CODE COMMENTS>
In Eclipse, I have taken care to make sure comment lines within a comment block are aligned with one another. However, I notice that when viewed through generic text editor, the alignment may be off depending on window shape and size.
